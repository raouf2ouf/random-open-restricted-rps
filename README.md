# [Random Open] Restricted RPS

**TLDR;** A Prouvably fair multiplayer Card Game based on Rock Paper Scissors. Players join by providing a collateral and recieve <em>6 random cards</em> (a collection of Rock, Paper, Scissors cards) and <em>3 stars</em>. Players play matches by chosing a card and betting a number of stars. At the end of the game, if a player has no more cards, he can redeem his stars for collateral. The fairness of the game is proven by the blockchain and any cheating is automatically detected.

**Disclamer:** The previous version of this game [https://github.com/raouf2ouf/restricted-rps](https://github.com/raouf2ouf/restricted-rps) won the second best project at the [Encode x Lightlink Hackathon]() and the new verson is submitted to the Encode x Polkadot Hackathon 24Q1.

## Changes for the Polkadot hackathon

The previous version of this game submitted for the Encode x LightLink hackathon (won second best project) had various shortcommings pointed out by the judges, mainly, **scaling**. In the new version, we use **Acurast.com** and **GetBlock.io** to address these weaknesses. The following table explains the main changes:

| Architecture                | **Client-Server**<br> A server is needed for automatic game creation, cards distribution, game closing, and distribution of player rewards. This Nodejs server relies on multiple Etherjs listeners. <br/>**Main issues:** <ol><li><u>_Reliability:</u>_ The server fails regularly due to too many RPC http calls (for listeners) and too many submitted transactions at the same time.</li><li><u>_Trust_:</u> while the game is desined to eliminate the need for trusted third party, players need a minimum level of trust towards the server as its computations are not publically verifiable (initial deck generation, cards given to players) [even if any cheating done by the server will be publically detected at the end of game].</li><li><u>_Blockchain support:_</u> the server was already struggling listening to one blockchain, it needs a complete redesign for it to support multiple blockchains.</li></ol> | **Serverless and fully decentrelized**<br> With the help of _Acurast_ cloud computing, a server is no longer needed, making the game 100% decentralised.<br/>**Solutions:**<ul><li><u>_Reliability:_</u> with the use of multiple Acurast Jobs that start at different intervals, we can realiably automate the various tasks that a game needs. Furthermore, with the use of Getblock websocket RPCs we can limite the execution time of these jobs to 1-2 seconds at most.</li><li><u>_Trust:_</u> with the change from hidden cards to open cards (see game design for more info), players no longer need to trust a thrid party (they will need to trust Acurast Rng numbers but that is a given).</li><li><u>_Blockchain support:_</u> Now that the source of rng and automatisation is Acurast jobs, we can serve any EVM or Substrate chains. We currently have 8 jobs total: 4 jobs handle player Rng for EVM and Substrate, and 4 jobs that handle automatic game closing and reward destribution.</li></ul> |

| Scaling RPC calls           | The game requires more than 50 RPC calls per second. Furthermore, any lag on contract event listener can negatively impact the ability of players to make the right choice of cards. The handling of contracts event was not optimised along with the inability of the RPC to respond quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | By using multiple Getblock.io websocket RPC and optimising RPC calls (40 calls per second per game) we achieve fluid gameplay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Scaling Blockchains support | In this version, only 1 blockchain (LightLink) was supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | By using Acurast as a chain-agnostic RNG provider along with Getblock RPCs we can support multiple evm and polkadot chains. Currently, we deployed the game for: Fantom Testnet, Azero Testnet, Polygon Mumbai, LightLink Testnet. Furthermore, deploying to a new blockchain is relatively straightforward as it only requires creating a Getblock RPC API keys and Acurast Jobs (along with integrating the proper wallet on the frontend).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
