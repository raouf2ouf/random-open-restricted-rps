# [Random Open] Restricted RPS

**TLDR;** A Prouvably fair multiplayer Card Game based on Rock Paper Scissors. Players join by providing a collateral and recieve <em>6 random cards</em> (a collection of Rock, Paper, Scissors cards) and <em>3 stars</em>. Players play matches by chosing a card and betting a number of stars. At the end of the game, if a player has no more cards, he can redeem his stars for collateral. The fairness of the game is proven by the blockchain and any cheating is automatically detected.

**Disclamer:** The previous version of this game [https://github.com/raouf2ouf/restricted-rps](https://github.com/raouf2ouf/restricted-rps) won the second best project at the [Encode x Lightlink Hackathon]() and the new verson is submitted to the Encode x Polkadot Hackathon 24Q1. Details on the changes can be found [here](#changes-for-the-polkadot-hackathon).

## Changes for the Polkadot hackathon

The previous version of this game submitted for the Encode x LightLink hackathon (won second best project) had various shortcommings pointed out by the judges, mainly, **scaling**. In the new version, we use **Acurast.com** and **GetBlock.io** to address these weaknesses. The following table explains the main changes:

| Architecture                | **Client-Server**<br> A server is needed for automatic game creation, cards distribution, game closing, and distribution of player rewards. This Nodejs server relies on multiple Etherjs listeners. <br/>**Main issues:** <ol><li><u>_Reliability:</u>_ The server fails regularly due to too many RPC http calls (for listeners) and too many submitted transactions at the same time.</li><li><u>_Trust_:</u> while the game is desined to eliminate the need for trusted third party, players need a minimum level of trust towards the server as its computations are not publically verifiable (initial deck generation, cards given to players) [even if any cheating done by the server will be publically detected at the end of game].</li><li><u>_Blockchain support:_</u> the server was already struggling listening to one blockchain, it needs a complete redesign for it to support multiple blockchains.</li></ol> | **Serverless and fully decentrelized**<br> With the help of _Acurast_ cloud computing, a server is no longer needed, making the game 100% distributed.<br/>**Solutions:**<ul><li><u>_Reliability:_</u></li><li><u>_Trust:_</u></li><li><u>_Blockchain support:_</u></li></ul> |
